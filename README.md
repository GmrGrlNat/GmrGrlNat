- 👋 Hi, I’m @GmrGrlNat
- 👀 I’m interested in just learning all I can! I'm switching from a career in healthcare over to the technology sector. I'm trying
    to keep an open mind as I explore what all is out there for me!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript via The Odin Project!
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate just yet as I'm still getting my feet wet. I'm a little shy, so I'd like to have more 
    confidence in my abilities beforehand.
- 📫 How to reach me: Uhh... we'll get to that later :)
